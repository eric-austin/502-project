# CreateCombinationsScript.py
#
# Developed by Jeffrey Rissman
#
# This is a Python script that is used to generate a Vensim command script.
# The Vensim command script will enable Vensim to run simulations of many policies.
# The resulting command script will run simulations with all unique combinations of
# settings of enabled policies. Which policies should be enabled
# and what settings should be included in the Vensim simulations are specified here in
# the Python script, prior to using it to generate a Vensim command script.


# File Names
# ----------
# Rather than including input and output file names in the code below, we assign all the file
# names to variables in this section.  This allows the names to be easily changed if desired.
ModelFile = "EPS.mdl" # The name of the Vensim model file (typically with .mdl or .vpm extension)
OutputScript = "GeneratedCombinationsScript.cmd" # The desired filename of the Vensim command script to be generated
RunResultsFile = "RunResults.tsv" # The desired filename for TSV file containing model run results
OutputVarsFile = "OutputVarsToExport.lst" # The name of the file containing a list of variables to be included in the RunResultsFile
                                          # May optionally also be used as a SAVELIST for Vensim (see below)

# Other Settings
# --------------
RunName = "MostRecentRun" # The desired name for all runs performed.  Used as the filename for the VDF files that Vensim
						  # creates and included in a separate column in the RunResultsFile.
MinPolicyCols = 0 # At least this many columns for policy settings will be added to the RunResultsFile.  If you have enabled
				  # fewer policies than this, the extra columns will be blank.  The purpose of this setting is to make it
				  # easier to append various RunResultsFiles together, when they use different numbers of enabled policies,
				  # and still have the columns line up correctly.
PolicySchedule = 1 # The number of the policy implementation schedule file to be used (in InputData/plcy-schd/FoPITY)
				  

# Index definitions
# -----------------
# Each policy is a Python list.  The numbers below are a key to the meaning of the four entries
# that compose each policy, so we can refer to them by meaningful names in the code.
# Note that the fourth entry in each policy, Settings, is itself a list that contains various
# setting values.  Do not change any names or numbers in this section.
Enabled = 0
LongName = 1
ShortName = 2
Settings = 3


# Policy Options
# --------------
# This section specifies which policies should be included in the Vensim command script
# (called here "enabled" policies) and what setting values for those policies should
# be included.  Unless you have enabled "IndividualPoliciesOnly" mode, all non-repeating
# combinations of the settings for enabled policies will
# be included in the Vensim command script, so do not enable too many policies at once, or
# Vensim will be unable to complete the necessary runs in a reasonable amount of time.
# Each policy is on a single line.  You may change the first entry of each policy to
# "True" to enable the policy or "False" to disable it.
# The fourth entry in each policy is a list of setting values enclosed with square brackets.
# You may change these values, add more values (separated by commas), and delete values.
# Any enabled policy must have a minimum of one setting value.  A policy that is disabled
# and a policy with a setting of zero produce identical results.
